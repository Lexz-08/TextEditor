## TextEditor
### Description
Unofficially the most advanced text/code editing application/program I have ever made. Completely free just like every other thing I program.

### Editors Available
  - Text Editor
  - Code Editor
  - Notepad

### Features Coming Soon
  - Settings (To save and load your changes instead of the constant default values)
    - Unfortunately due to the size of the changes to the program from implementing this feature, I will not be implementing it for a while.
    - I would have to modify pretty much every aspect of all the code in every file just to make this feature work, so it's more of a, "after everything else is done I will implement it."
