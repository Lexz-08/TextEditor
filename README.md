## TextEditor
### Description
Unofficially the most advanced text/code editing application/program I have ever made. Completely free just like every other thing I program.

### Editors Available
  - Text Editor (Basic Text Editing)
  - Code Editor (Basic Code Editing)

### Features Coming Soon
  - Information Displayer (Bottom of Text/Code Editor)
  - Notepad (You will not be able to open/save files with this.)
  - The ability to change the current language of the code editor.
  - Tell the program whether or not it should/can show if the menu's allow the 'Checked' property to show the true/false state.
  - Settings (To save and load your changes instead of the constant default values)
    - Unfortunately due to the size of the changes to the program from implementing this feature, I will not be implementing it for a while.
    - I would have to modify pretty much every aspect of all the code in every file just to make this feature work, so it's more of a, "after everything else is done I will implement it."
  - SO MANY MORE FEATURES TO COME THAT ARE UNLISTED.
